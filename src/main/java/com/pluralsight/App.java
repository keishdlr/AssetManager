//        the assets.
//        Now, loop thru the Asset collection displaying the description of each asset, the
//        date you acquired it, how much you paid for it, and its value.
//        When that works, go back and include in the display either the address of the
//        house or the year and make/model of the vehicle.  You will need to use
//                instanceof when you loop through the assets to detect the type of asset it is.
//        Once you know it is a House or Vehicle, you will need to downcast it so that you
//        can call the methods of the specific type.
